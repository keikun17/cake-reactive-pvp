        <h2>1. 1Gate-Robo</h2>

<h3>Defensive</h3>

<p><strong>1. StarGate-Robo-Expand</strong></p>

<p>Keep your expansion safe by keeping them at their base with the phoenix.
If they went went for collo, poke them as they start pushing out or whenever you can. If they push out with immortals, stop probe production and keep tabs with their army with phoenix. Lift immortals immediately at the beginning of the engagement.</p>

<h3>Offensive</h3>

<h2><em>WIP</em></h2>

<h2>2. 3-gate blink stalkers</h2>

<h3>Defensive</h3>

<p>**1. 3 Stalker opening to robo expand **</p>

<pre><code>9   scout,
10  CB Nexus        # after first pylon
13  Gate            # won't leave you with enough mins
                    # for the 14'th probe. It's OK.
14  Assimilator
    CB Nexus 
15  Core
16  Pylon

When Core is 75% done
    Build Gate-2

When Gateway-1 is done  
    Train Stalker-1, CB once
        Stalker-1 will:
            1. Scout your natural for proxies
            2. Scout 3rd base for proxies
            3. Head to farthest watchtower
            4. Snipe probes as they go out.

Get 2nd Assimilator

When Stalker-1 is done
    Train Stalker-2, CB once

When Gateway-2 is done
    Train Stalker-3 from there, CB once
    Send a probe to watchtower where Stalker-1 is 
        1. So you still hold tower when Stalker kills
        probes moving out       
        2. If 9-scout probe survived, use her instead

When 3rd Stalker is out
    Build Robo
    Build Gateway-3
    Expand

Spend all chronos on immortals, keep probing

Split army at the bottom and one on the top
    Each in its own control group
    Each with its own Immortal

Chrono an obs out when you have 2 immortals, rally 
it to enemy base.
    This obs will :
    1. scout for expo
    2. scout for tech
